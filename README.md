Lighting control software for Solid State Depot (SSD)

Dan made the LED lighting system in Solid State Depot controllable with a UDP interface, and this code animates the light. Animates all zones in SSD (lobby walls, lobby lanterns, bay white lights, bay colors, bay accents). Effects:

* Random fully-saturated colors with fades, on horizontal rows, vertical columns, and diagonals.
* Alternating between "warm" and "cold" whites.
* "Lightning" effect where all the bay white lights are turned on and off
